# Technical Test for PT Eigen Tri Mathema by Satrio Kamaludin

# Frontend News App

A part of this test is to develop a desktop web application using ReactJS with TypeScript, the functionality of this web app including:
- Search News by title, content, and description
- Toogle News by categories
- Browse News with pagination feature

As for styling and customization of UI, I've decided to use Ant Design (https://ant.design/) to enhance the UI of the web app.

Note: I have implemented several features, including category filtering and search functionality. However due to NewsAPI's rate limits and it's terms of services for it's uses, further development and testing have been constrained. Consequently, some features, such as displaying detailed news information upon card click, are pending implementation.

As for the other limitations, the NewsAPI does not allow the use of API on the deployed web app platform, such as Vercel, Netlify, and other platforms.

Thank you for understanding, and I appreciate your consideration of the limitations posed by external factors during the development process.
