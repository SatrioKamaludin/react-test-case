# Technical Test for PT Eigen Tri Mathema by Satrio Kamaludin

# Frontend News App

A part of this test is to develop a desktop web application using ReactJS with TypeScript, the functionality of this web app including:
- Search News by title, content, and description
- Toogle News by categories
- Browse News with pagination feature

As for styling and customization of UI, I've decided to use Ant Design (https://ant.design/) to enhance the UI of the web app.

Note: the NewsAPI does not allow the use of API on the deployed web app platform, such as Vercel, Netlify, and other platforms. Hence it's limited to local only implementation.
